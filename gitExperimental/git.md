# JupyterLab Git

This tutorial is about the Git extension for JupyterLab. More than likely, you've seen Git before, so this is not a tutorial on how to use Git for version control or any such thing. Rather, this is a brief tutorial on the main features of the Git extension, focusing especially on the diff features for notebooks.

Go over Branches
- Go over how to create a new branch under the branches button

Go over Changes and History
- Compare the Changes tab to ```git status```
- Compare the History tab to ```git log```

Add and remove files from being committed
- Show that ```git add <file> <file>``` is frustrating
- Compare to ```git commit -m ""```
- Mention the description section as a nice feature compared to ```git commit -m "" -m ""``` or ```git commit``` with several lines

Go over diffing with the git extension
- Use both notebook and file examples
- For the notebooks, use the code formatter extension for help

Go over reverting changes in the History tab

## Example

The example is from this notebook:
