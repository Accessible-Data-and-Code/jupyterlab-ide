# JupyterLab Git Tutorial

This tutorial is about the Git extension for JupyterLab. More than likely, you've seen Git before, so this is not a tutorial on how to use Git for version control or any such thing. Rather, this is a brief tutorial on the main features of the Git extension, focusing especially on the diff features for notebooks.

## Branches

For the sake of learning how this extension works, you will create a new branch. On the same sidebar as your file browser, you will see a button that looks like the Git logo:

<img
     style="display: block;
            margin-left: auto;
            margin-right: auto;
            width: 5%;"
     src="https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/social-media-2169/24/social_media_social_media_logo_git-64.png"
/>

Click on that button and you should have a new tab pop up with information about the repository you are on (it should be "jupyterlab-ide" or something similar) and its various branches. In this tab, you can hide and show a selection pane for branches in the repository. You can select branches from this menu, merge two branches, or even delete branches while only using the buttons available from the menu.

Right now though, you should create a new branch and title it "gitExercise" using the <kbd>New Branch</kbd> button. Using this branch, you can see even more of the features of the Git extension.

## Changes

Now that you have created a new branch, it's time to do something interesting on it. If you haven't already, complete the Code Formatter tutorial because this example requires knowledge of using the Code Formatter extension included in this repository.

First, go to the ```gitExample.ipynb``` file in the ```gitExtension``` folder and open it. This file is an example workflow borrowed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).<sup>[1](#kagglebook)</sup> To make changes to the notebook, we will format it with our different code formatters. To start, select every cell in the notebook and, using the <kbd>Edit</kbd> tab, format the whole notebook with the Black code formatter and save the file. This formatted notebook is a serious change from the original and should be committed as a change to your new branch.

Rather than opening up a terminal and using:
- ```git status``` to see what files have been changed
- ```git add <file> <file> ...``` to stage those changes
- ```git commit -m "<message>"``` to commit those changes

you can just go to the <kbd>Changes</kbd> tab in Git extension menu and go to the files in the "Changed" drop down. You will see the ```gitExample.ipynb``` file and, mousing over it, several different options. If you hit the <kbd>+</kbd> button, the changes made will be staged. Use this to stage the changes you made to ```gitExample.ipynb```.

Once they are staged, you can go to the text boxes at the bottom of the Git extension menu and enter both a summary of the changes AND a description of those changes. Add a summary of the changes however you want to describe it and add a description about which code formatter you used (Black) on which file (```gitExample.ipynb```) and the reason you did it (for this tutorial exercise). Once you have finished, commit the changes using the <kbd>Commit</kbd> button below the text fields. This will allow us to use the extension to check and manipulate version history.

## History

Now that you have committed changes on a branch, go to the <kbd>History</kbd> tab. This tab displays all the different changes to history of a branch, including mergers, in an interactive menu. Compared to the different ways to use ```git log```, with the ```--graph``` and ```--oneline``` options especially, this interface is cleaner to use and more intuitive.

If you click on

- Notice the revert and reset buttons

- Look at file changes



Go over diffing with the git extension
- Use both notebook and file examples
- For the notebooks, use the code formatter extension for help

Go over reverting changes in the History tab

Some alterations have been made so that users can see the differences between differently formatted versions of the document. The only alterations are to code formatting.
