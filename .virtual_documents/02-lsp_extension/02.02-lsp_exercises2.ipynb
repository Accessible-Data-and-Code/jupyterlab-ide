# Exercise 10 - Write a function with a single parameter

def greet(name):

greeting = greet  # Missing the 'name' parameter

# Use the Signature Help feature to get information about the function's parameters by typing the open parenthesis 


# Exercise 11 - Write a function with multiple parameters

    subtotal = item_price * quantity
    tax_amount = subtotal * (tax_rate / 100)

# Use the Signature Help feature to get information about the function's parameters


# Exercise 12 - Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number

# Use the Signature Help feature to get information about the function's parameters as you did in the previous exercises


# Exercise 13 - Identify Syntax Errors

print("Hello, World!"
name = "Alice"

# Use the Code Linting feature to identify syntax errors and fix the error. You should see a red underline under 2 places.


# Exercise 14 - Identify Undefined Variables

message = "Hello, World!"
print(mesage)

# Use the Code Linting feature to identify undefined variables. Again you should see a red line under "mesage"


# Exercise 15 - Write code with unreachable code
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return

print("Goodbye, World!")
greet()

# Use the Code Linting feature to identify unreachable code
