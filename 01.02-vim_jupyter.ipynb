Especially worth noting though is that the clipboard for normal mode is not the same as your system clipboard. For example, if you use Windows, using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> will paste anything loaded into it using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. It will not paste anything yanked by the user in Vim's normal mode. Additionally, anything yanked or deleted from one notebook in Vim normal mode can be pasted into a separate notebook. Just keep this in mind.\n",

That rule is true in normal mode and for much other navigation. Those keybindings were most useful for ```jupyterlab-vim```, but that's not all there is to Vim. While it is outside the scope of this tutorial to practice, users can press <kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> to navigate left and right respectively in a document using normal mode. This allows users to keep their right hand from the arrowkeys and, theoretically, speeds up document editing and navigation. This and other quality of life features can be found in any number of Vim tutorials. If the Vim extension would be useful to you and you haven't had much practice with Vim, it may be worth looking into more documentation about Vim later."
