    "# JupyterLab Command and JupyterLab Edit\n",
    "JupyterLab has two different modes when interacting with code in a notebook environment: command mode and edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In command mode, the user is not directly editing any particular cells. Rather, the user is navigating the whole notebook and interacting with cells on a larger scale. If you right click on a cell, you should see options to cut, copy, and paste selected cells. Those commands are part of JupyterLab Command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In edit mode, the user is directly editing the contents of a cell. Without ```jupyterlab-vim```, this uses, with exceptions for JupyterLab specific shortcuts, the same keyboard shortcuts that you would use for a processor like Microsoft Word or something simple like Notepad (or whatever equivalent comes to mind for your particular operating system). With the addition of ```jupyterlab-vim```, JupyterLab Edit mode is extended into several additional modes, each tied to Vim editor.\n",

    "# Brief notes on Vim\n",
    "\n",
    "Vim is a text editor first released in 1991. It has several convenient keyboard shortcuts that can help with quickly editing a document. These features can be accessed through two of Vim's different modes: insert and normal. While insert and normal are not the only vim modes available (visual, command, and replace modes are also implemented), these modes are the relevant modes for understanding the additional features in JupyterLab Command. These features have been brought to JupyterLab through the ```jupyterlab-vim``` extension. If you have used Vim before, most of this next section will be stuff you are already acquainted with. If you haven't used Vim before but you are interested in learning more and applying it to the JupyterLab environment, there are several excellent tutorials for how to use Vim. For now, we will stick to some basics in Vim's normal mode. These things serve as a precursor for how ```jupyterlab-vim``` operates uniquely with the cell-based notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things you can do in Vim normal mode\n",
    "When you first edit text in a cell with the Vim extension enabled, you will start with a blinking cursor that indicates you are in normal mode. If you are editing a cell in insert mode, you can press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to enter normal mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal mode, you can do the following things:\n",
    "Keystrokes | Effects\n",
    ":---:|---\n",
    "<kbd>D</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> | This deletes a line and copies it to the clipboard\n",
    "<kbd>Y</kbd> + <kbd>Y</kbd> | This copies a line to the clipboard\n",
    "<kbd>P</kbd> | This pastes from the keyboard\n",
    "<kbd>U</kbd> | This will undo an action in normal mode\n",
    "<kbd>O</kbd> | This will add a line after the current line\n",
    "<kbd>K</kbd> | Move up one line\n",
    "<kbd>J</kbd> | Move down one line\n",
    "<kbd>G</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> | Select the first line\n",
    "<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> | Select the last line\n",
    "\n",
    "Versions of these, but applied to cells in JupyterLab Command mode, also exist. We will learn more about them later! For now, play around a little bit. Below is the classic lorem ipsum text in a markdown cell. Try out some of these keystrokes."

    "In Vim normal mode, we already saw that <kbd>J</kbd> could be used to navigate down one line and <kbd>K</kbd> used to navigate up one line. That rule is true in normal mode and for much other navigation. While it is outside the scope of this tutorial to practice, users can press <kbd>H</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> to navigate left and right respectively in a document using normal mode. This allows users to keep their right hand from the arrowkeys and, theoretically, speeds up document editing and navigation. This and other quality of life features can be found in any number of Vim tutorials. If the Vim extension would be useful to you and you haven't had much practice with Vim, it may be worth looking into more documentation about Vim later."
